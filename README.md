# Tools
These are online tools with free/reduced prices for education plans. Apply for them for the everyday use of your organisation or for teaching purposes.

All the tools are listed in [the Wiki](https://github.com/Weekend-School-International/Tools/wiki)


If you'd like to share a tool you come across, here's how to do it.

1. Create a page

- Under Code, click > Add File > Create New File
- You will be asked to enter the title for the page which should be Tools/ XXX. Enter the name of the tool under XXX but remember to save as .md (this means the page is saved as a Markdown page, and not a code). For example, if your tool is called **Annie**, you should save as Tools/Annie.md
- Refer to this [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for styling of your page.
- Save the file. Once you save it, copy the URL of that file which should be something like: https://github.com/Weekend-School-International/Tools/blob/main/**XXX**.md

2. Link this page back to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Weekend-School-International/Tools/wiki). 

- Type the name of the tool, example Annie on the Wiki. 
- Use link the name of the tool back to the page you have just created

Every tool should be it's own entry in the Wiki.

Please include a short blurb on the usage of the tool and the relevant link to apply for the free/discounted usage
