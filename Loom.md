## What does it do
1. This tool allows you to record and immediately publish. It does not require download and upload or any such tedious steps. Instead the moment you stop recording, it creates a link that you can immediately share with others.
This is useful when you want to create bite size lessons that can be assessed by your students at their own time.

2. You can choose to record only the screen, the screen and your face or only your face. This makes it easier for you to explain say a powerpoint on screen.

3. You can use their writing tool to write on the screen
